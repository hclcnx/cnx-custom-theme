  <h1><a name="about"></a>Preview available in the App Catalog!</h1>
  <h2>About the App</a></h2>
  <p>The Connections Design Team is crafting new design specifications for Connections. You can preview the new visual styles by installing the application, from the IBM Connections Cloud App Catalog, which leverages the Connections Customizer technology. There is not an App Catalog for IBM Connections on premises at this time.</p>

  <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
  <p>Customizer is available on IBM Connections Cloud for tenants of the North America and Europe data centers. Before using Customizer your organization must first register for the service by sending an email with some simple information. Refer to section 3 of the <a href="https://github.com/ibmcnxdev/customizer" target="_blank">IBM Connections Customizer documentation</a> for more details.</p>


  <h4><a class="anchor" name="preview">What's included in the Preview</a></h4>
  <p>Because this is a Preview, it is recommended that you enable the application for a sub-set of users.</p>
  <p>This release is a preview and has limitations, which include:
  <ul>
    <li>Only works with the default theme, called "Verse Theme (Default)".</li>
    <li>Does not support bi-directional languages.</li>
    <li>Might contain defects.</li>
    <li>This preview applies to the following applications and pages:
      <ul>
        <li>Files</li>
        <li>File viewer</li>
        <li>Profiles</li>
        <li>Contacts</li>
        <li>Search results page</li>
        <li>Meetings launch page, but not the meeting room</li>
        <li>Global elements, such as navigation and search, only updated on apps in the preview.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="updates">Updates</a></h4>
<p>Updates to this application will be pushed out to fix defects and add styling to more applications and pages.</p>


  <h2><a class="anchor" name="install">Install and Configure the App</a></h2>
  <p>Find Visual Update 1 for IBM Connections in the App Catalog. Get the app and configure it. </p>
  <h4>Important notes before installing</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>When first configured, the application is enabled for the entire organization. It is recommended that you first enable for a sub-set of users.</li>
  <li>This application is only intended to be used with Verse Theme (Default), which can be selected in the Theme section of Administration.</li>
</ul>

  <h4>Enable for no users or a sub-set of users</h4>
  <p>You can install the application and enable it for no users or a sub-set of users. This way you control who will see the new visual updates.</p>
  <p>To enable for no users or a sub-set of users, customize the extension that was installed when you enabled the app.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>After installing the application, in Administration, go to Organization Extensions.</li>
    <li>At the top of the page, follow the new Apps Manager link.</li>
    <li>Click on the name of the app to edit the extension.</li>
    <li>Edit the json to add "match", "user-email", and values to the payload section, as follows.</li>

    <p>Enable for no users by adding a fake email address inside "user-email":</p>

    <pre class="code">
    "payload": {
      "match": {
        "user-email": [
          "userid1@example.com"
        ]
      },
      "include-files":[
        "periscope.js"
      ],
      "include-repo": {
        "name":"periscope"
      }
    },
    </pre>

<p>Enable for a sub-set of users by adding email addresses inside "user-email":</p>
  <pre class="code">
  "payload": {
    "match": {
      "user-email": [
        "userid1@example.com",
        "userid2@example.com"
      ]
    },
    "include-files":[
      "periscope.js"
    ],
    "include-repo": {
      "name":"periscope"
    }
  },
  </pre>
</ol>


  <h4>Disable the application</h4>
  <p><span style="color:red;">Use caution before disabling a customized application.</span> If you disable the application, your customizations will be lost. Save the customized json to another location before disabling the application.</p>
<p>To disable the application:</p>
<ol>
  <li>After installing the application, in Administration, go to Apps.</li>
  <li>Go to My Apps and locate Visual Update 1 for IBM Connections.</li>
  <li>In the overflow menu select Disable.</li>
  <li>Confirm that you want to disable the application because this will remove the Organization Extension and any customizations you made.</li>
</ol>

  <h4>Enable for entire organization</h4>
  <p>If you have previously enabled for a sub-set of users, edit the json again and remove the "match" and "user-email" matches in the payload section.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to Organization Extensions.</li>
    <li>At the top of the page, follow the new Apps Manager link.</li>
    <li>Click on the name of the app to edit the extension.</li>
    <li>Edit the json to remove "match", "user-email", and specific email addresses in the payload section, as follows.</li>

  <pre class="code">
  "payload": {
    "include-files":[
      "periscope.js"
    ],
    "include-repo": {
      "name":"periscope"
    }
  },
  </pre>
</ol>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<h4>Why don't I see Visual Update 1 changes?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight:600;">Question: </span>Why don't I see any visual updates after I enable Visual Update 1?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600;">Answer: </span>Check the following things:
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure you have Customizer enabled. For more information about what apps have updated styles, see <a href="#about">About this Example</a>.</li>
    <li>Visual updates are only applied to a sub-set of Connections applications at this time. Look for changes in Files and Profiles. For more information about what apps have updated styles, see <a href="#about">About this Example</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>What is supported</h3>
<p>The Visual Update 1 for IBM Connections is supported only for implementations where the application is installed and configured directly from the IBM Connections App Catalog and in which all of the following criteria are met: (1) Only the Verse Theme (Default) is enabled (2) No additional customizations are configured. Implementations added manually through an organization extension, combined with additional customizations, and/or contained code which was modified from its original state will not receive support considerations.</p>

<p>Due to the preview nature of the application, PMRs will not be accepted and resolved by IBM. Questions and support requests, however, can be posted directly on the support forum located here. IBM will not assist with making modifications to the open source code provided for this application nor modifications created to add additional customizations in lieu of the Visual Update 1 for IBM Connections.</p>

<p>While the application is in preview, bi-directional language support will not be included. Visual updates will apply only to applications stated in official communications and will not extend to custom widgets added to Connections. IBM plans to regularly add new Connections applications to the visual update and will share communications accordingly.</p>
