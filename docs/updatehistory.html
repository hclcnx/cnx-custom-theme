Examples of 'style fixes' typically include updates so that elements of the page are not cut off, misaligned, or missing.

<h4>Visual Update 1 Cloud app now performs faster</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The app configuration has been updated to inject CSS references on each page rather than use JavaScript. This results in much faster performance when the styles load.</li>

      <li>If you have altered the JSON configuration for the application, by adding individual users or additional parameters, it is recommended that you copy your JSON changes before continuing.</li>
      <li>If you have not altered the application, continue forward.</li>
      <li>As an administrator, go to <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage Organization</strong>.</li>
      <li>Go to <strong>Apps</strong> and then <strong>My Apps</strong>.</li>
      <li>Locate Visual Update 1 for IBM Connections, select the three dot more menu, and <strong>Disable</strong> it.</li>
      <li>Once the app is disabled, select the three dot more menu again, and <strong>Delete</strong> the app.</li>
      <li>Switch from My Apps to <strong>App Catalog</strong>, find the Visual Update 1 app again, and <strong>Get</strong> it.</li>
      <li>During configuration you can enable it for your entire organization or individuals.</li>

<p>Initial release of the Visual Update 1 for IBM Connections application.</p>

<p>The IBM Collaboration Solution's Design team is crafting a new, modern, design language for IBM Connections in an effort to ensure that our solutions match the way we think, augment our performance, and grant us the confidence we need to get our jobs done.</p>

<p>We are opening up a preview of the new design, within IBM Connections. The new design creates a modern, airy, and less cluttered appearance by updating many items on a page, such as lists, forms, buttons, and icons. This preview applies to the following applications and pages:
<ul>
<li>Files</li>
<li>File viewer</li>
<li>Profiles</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
<li>Search results page</li>
<li>Meetings launch page, but not the meeting room</li>
<li>Notification Settings</li>
<li>Navigation bar for the above applications and pages</li>
<li>Notificaiton Center for the above applications and pages</li>
</ul>
</p>

<!--<h3>FAQ</h3>
<h4>Why don't I see Visual Update 1 changes?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight:600;">Question: </span>Why don't I see any visual updates after I enable Visual Update 1?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600;">Answer: </span>Check the following things:
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure you have Customizer enabled. For more information about what apps have updated styles, see <a href="#about">About this Example</a>.</li>
    <li>Visual updates are only applied to a sub-set of Connections applications at this time. Look for changes in Files and Profiles. For more information about what apps have updated styles, see <a href="#about">About this Example</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>-->

<h3>What is supported</h3>
<p>The Visual Update 1 for IBM Connections is supported only for implementations where the application is installed and configured directly from the IBM Connections App Catalog and in which all of the following criteria are met: (1) Only the Verse Theme (Default) is enabled (2) No additional customizations are configured. Implementations added manually through an organization extension, combined with additional customizations, and/or contained code which was modified from its original state will not receive support considerations.</p>

<p>Due to the preview nature of the application, PMRs will not be accepted and resolved by IBM. Questions and support requests, however, can be posted directly on the support forum located here. IBM will not assist with making modifications to the open source code provided for this application nor modifications created to add additional customizations in lieu of the Visual Update 1 for IBM Connections.</p>

<p>While the application is in preview, bi-directional language support will not be included. Visual updates will apply only to applications stated in official communications and will not extend to custom widgets added to Connections. IBM plans to regularly add new Connections applications to the visual update and will share communications accordingly.</p>
